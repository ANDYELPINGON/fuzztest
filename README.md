# FuzzTest

FuzzTest is a new open-source C++ fuzz testing framework targeted for developers
(instead of security researchers) that focuses on ease of use.

## Quickstart with Bazel

To set up a development environment with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and to
get a simple fuzz test working, follow our
[Quickstart with Bazel](doc/quickstart-bazel.md) tutorial.
